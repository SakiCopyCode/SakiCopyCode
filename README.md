- 👋 Hi, I’m @SakiCopyCode
- 👀 I’m interested in copying other code and pasting in my code so that I don't have to write it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning no thing since i am someone who copy other code if i need it
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping me to allow copy your code and making my coder life easier so that I don't have to brain storm myself thanks
- 😄 Pronouns: he
- ⚡ Fun fact: i love to thef the other property so don't put me in a legal fight since i can't fight because i am sure i will loose it even if i try and i don't want to waste money for nothing in return
